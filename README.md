# The-OGPTC-Project
With the OGPTC Open source projetc, you can build your own AI based Chatbot. Download the source code from here and help the community to make powerful AI based tools!

# Required tools
To code your AI, **you first need a computer or a laptop at least then get VS Code, be sure to have Python 3 with Tkinter support on your device and then download the source code.**
All you have to do is coding using **Python**!

If you don't know how to code using Python, learn how to use it first before modifying anything to the source code.

# Explaining the components of the source code
  # 1-Imports
  Once you open the source code you can see that there are already **three imports**, one for **tkinter** (for window management), another for **messagebox**(for informations about the program), then one for **time** (for loading files and time management)

  # 2-Database
  The database contains all answers for every question the user asks to the chatbot (We will see later another code component for the asked questions), if the question doesn't match any answer from the database, so the chatbot won't answer the question. Add every answer for every question so the chatbot will answer any question.

  # 4-Settings
  This other code component contains the adjustable settings for your chatbot if you want to try them, press **F5**, select your **debugger** then choose settings, a window called settings will appear so you can see the available settings (You can also try your chatbot btw).

  # 5-Questions
  The questions sections contain every question for every answer available to the database (As we saw in the database section), add and modify questions to answers that you've already added to the database.

# Verifying results
Press **F5** on your keyboard (Or open the souce code as a Python 3 file so you can acces the console and the window), then choose your **Python debugger** and then your chatbot will appear on a **window**.

As you can see here, we have created a functionnal chatbot ready to assist us at anytime, even **OFFLINE**!

_Powerful Tip: Save your work before running the program or quitting the IDE!_
